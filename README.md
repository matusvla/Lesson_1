**Homework**:
1. Create a program main.cpp which writes out numbers from 1 to 5 compile it using g++ and run it in Terminal
2. Set up student account on Github
3. Create a private Github repository with only one member main.cpp (no README)
4. Create a branch named writingBackwards and go to this branch
5. Change the main.cpp in the branch writingBackwards so that it writes out numbers 5 to 1 and try it out
6. Make sure the code in master branch remained unchanged
**BONUS:** Enhance the program in master branch so that it displays numbers from 1 to 10000
